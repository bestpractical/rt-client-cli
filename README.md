# NAME

RT::Client::CLI - Provides the official rt command line client

# SYNOPSIS

See [rt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?rt).

# DESCRIPTION

RT::Client::CLI is a CPAN-ready package for the [rt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?rt) command-line program
that interacts with [RT](https://bestpractical.com/rt).

No code is changed from the program shipped with RT.  This is just an easy-to-
install package when you want the [rt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?rt) program on another computer.

The version of this package is kept in lockstep with the corresponding RT
version from which the included [rt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?rt) was extracted.
